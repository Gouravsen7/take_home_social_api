## Details of Implementation
* Using `takehome.io` to fetch data for all three social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.
* If the response code is 200, then the response body getting parsed.
* In case the response code is not 200 for a request to a particular social network which indicates something went be wrong, then I am adding this value: `[{ error_message: 'Something went wrong.' }]`
* Connection timeouts are also handled explicitly and the error message in this case.
`[{ error_message: 'Connection timed out.' }]`
* You can change error messages by changing in the `en.yml` file.
